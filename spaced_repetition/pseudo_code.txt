Algorithm: SpacedRepetitionScheduler
Goal:
  Decide when a user should revisit an old question using forgetting curve logic.

Input:
  - Question history: {last_seen, correct_count, incorrect_count}
  - Current date

Steps:
  1. For each question:
       interval_days = base_interval * (correct_count + 1) / (incorrect_count + 1)
       next_due = last_seen + interval_days
  2. If next_due <= today â†’ mark as "due for review"
Output:
  - List of questions due for review.
