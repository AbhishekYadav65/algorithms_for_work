Algorithm: AdaptiveDifficultyEngine
Goal:
  Adjust question difficulty based on user accuracy, time, and hints.

Input:
  - Accuracy (%)
  - Avg_Time (seconds)
  - Hints_Used (count)
  - Current_Level (easy/medium/hard)

Steps:
  1. Calculate performance_score = (accuracy * weight1) - (time_factor * weight2) - (hints_used * weight3)
  2. If performance_score > threshold_high → increase difficulty.
  3. If performance_score < threshold_low → decrease difficulty.
  4. Otherwise → keep same level.
Output:
  - New difficulty level.
